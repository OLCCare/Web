      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>The Sisters of Our Lady of China is a  Diocesan Religious Institute of Consecrated Life, dedicated to apostolic  mission work. The late Cardinal Tien, S.V.D., the first Asian born Cardinal in  the history of the Catholic Church, founded the community in 1940, in Shantung  Province, China.      </p>
      <p>After the Second World War, the Sisters left Mainland China and resettled in Taiwan in 1952, in the Chiai Diocese.</p>

The  Community, as followers of Christ and His Blessed Mother, are active in the  four-corners of the world. </p>
