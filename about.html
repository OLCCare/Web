      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>The Sisters of Our Lady of China is a  Diocesan Religious Institute of Consecrated Life, dedicated to apostolic  mission work. The late Cardinal Tien, S.V.D., the first Asian born Cardinal in  the history of the Catholic Church, founded the community in 1940, in Shantung  Province, China.      </p>
      <p>After the Second World War, the Sisters left Mainland China and resettled in Taiwan in 1952, in the Chiai Diocese.</p>

The  Community, as followers of Christ and His Blessed Mother, are active in the  four-corners of the world. </p>
      <p>They are engaged in pastoral care,  education, healthcare, care of the aged and in serving in areas wherever the  Bishops may call for help.</p>
      <p>In Taiwan, The Sisters of Our Lady of China  has established Chung Jen College of Nursing, Health Science and Management  with over 2,000 students; St Martin De Porres Hospital with 1,000 in-patient  beds, a 300-bed Nursing Home and the Home Care Group. They have won multiple  awards for their innovative development models and quality services. </p>
      <p align="left">In  December 1983, The Sisters of Our Lady of China established The Trustee of The  Sisters of Our Lady of China in Australia and on the 1st of January  1984, gained ownership of Peakhurst Nursing Home (now renamed as Peakhurst  Lodge). </p>
      <p>Over the years, The Sisters of Our Lady of  China has established itself as a preferred aged care service provider with  strong business sustainability and long term viability.      </p>
      <p align="left">Since 2004, we have  undergone major transformation from a single facility operator with 71 high  care beds, to a multi-facility operator with five modern facilities totaling  475 beds providing both low and high level care of high quality. </p>
      <p>Our five fully accredited facilities  provide high quality nursing and personal care and diversional activities to  anyone requiring high care and low care nursing placement, regardless of race,  religion, colour or creed.    </p>
